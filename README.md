I wanted to accomplish a better understanding of the Layer0 tool and how to utilize edge caching to increase and improve website load performance.

With more time, I would want to tweak the way certain assets are loaded and better target asset to cache based on logical customer flows and progressions.

The tool is extremely powerful and surprisingly easy to understand I can see where a website could be tweaked to the point of being able to load in an instant no matter where you are, using the edge caching
